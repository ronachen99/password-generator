## Description

The objective of establishing this repository is to develop a website that can produce random passwords according to specific user-defined criteria and desired password length.

<br>

## Demonstration

Here is a short demonstration of the website:

<br>

## Usage

The password generation process will include prompts to guide the user along the way: 

1. Once the user opens up the webpage, they will be prompted to press the red button. <br>

2. After the user presses the "Generate Password" button, they will prompted to enter a desired password length. <br>

3. After the user inputs the desired password length, they will be presented with a series of questions to select the types of characters they want to include in their password. <br>

4. Once the user answers all the prompts, a password is then generated inside the dashed box. <br>

If the user enters an invalid password length, then they will see the following:

1. An alert prompt that tells the user to enter an interger. <br>

2. A confirm message will ask the user whether or not they would like to try again. <br>

3. If user presses cancel, then they will see a message. <br>

4. If the user presses ok, then they will be redirected to enter a valid password length.

 <br>
If the user choose to have none of the character types, then they will see:

1. An alert prompt that tells the user to select at least one character type. <br>
